<h1>Terraform Azure Bastion Host Module</h1>
This Terraform module makes it easy to deploy an Azure Bastion Host , providing secure and seamless Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Secure Shell (SSH) access to virtual machines (VMs) inside a Virtual Network (VNet).
<br></br>
By using this module, you can deploy a Bastion Host quickly and easily, without the need to manually configure public IP addresses.

Simply specify the required input parameters, and this module will take care of the rest, creating a Bastion Host and configuring all the necessary resources to enable secure remote access to your VMs.
<br></br>
<h2>Usage</h2>
You can use this module in your Terraform configuration by including it as a module and providing the required input variables. Here is an example of how to use the module to create an Azure Bastion Host along with Public IP Address:

```hcl
module "bastion_host" {
  source                = "github.com/george-markou/Terraform-Azure//Network/bastionHost"
  resource_group_name   = "my-resource-group"
  location              = "eastus"
  pip_name              = "my-bas-pip-01"
  bastion_name          = "my-bas-01
  subnet_id             = "/subscriptions/<subcription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group-name>/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/<vnet-name>/subnets/<subnet-name>"
  copy_paste_enabled    = true
  file_copy_enabled     = false
  ip_connect_enabled    = true
  shareable_link_enabled = true
  tunneling_enabled     = false
  sku                   = "Standard"
  tags = {
    "Environment" = "Production"
  }
}
```
